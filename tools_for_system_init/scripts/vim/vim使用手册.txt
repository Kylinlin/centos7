ctrlp:
	Basic Usage

		Run :CtrlP or :CtrlP [starting-directory] to invoke CtrlP in find file mode.
		Run :CtrlPBuffer or :CtrlPMRU to invoke CtrlP in find buffer or find MRU file mode.
		Run :CtrlPMixed to search in Files, Buffers and MRU files at the same time.
Check :help ctrlp-commands and :help ctrlp-extensions for other commands.

	Once CtrlP is open:

		Press <F5> to purge the cache for the current directory to get new files, remove deleted files and apply new ignore options.
		Press <c-f> and <c-b> to cycle between modes.
		Press <c-d> to switch to filename only search instead of full path.
		Press <c-r> to switch to regexp mode.
		Use <c-j>, <c-k> or the arrow keys to navigate the result list.
		Use <c-t> or <c-v>, <c-x> to open the selected entry in a new tab or in a new split.
		Use <c-n>, <c-p> to select the next/previous string in the prompt's history.
		Use <c-y> to create a new file and its parent directories.
		Use <c-z> to mark/unmark multiple files and <c-o> to open them.
Run :help ctrlp-mappings or submit ? in CtrlP for more mapping help.

		Submit two or more dots .. to go up the directory tree by one or multiple levels.
		End the input string with a colon : followed by a command to execute it on the opening file(s):
		Use :25 to jump to line 25.
		Use :diffthis when opening multiple files to run :diffthis on the first 4 files.
